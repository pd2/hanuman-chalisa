I developed a multiple choice game as a web app. One can learn the meaning of verses from Hanuman Chalisa written in Awadhi language. When the player finds the correct rhyming pair of words  that complete the verse they will see the time taken and number of guesses they needed.  This game can be played either on a desktop or a hand held device.
